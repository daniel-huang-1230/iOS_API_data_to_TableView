# Overview
The goal of this simple app is to help me learn how to parse JSON data from some API and display it on the table view. 
The URL for the API used was from [here](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v1/all).

The app shows the country names as the title and its respective capital names as the detail in a single table cell. 
I also implemented/experimented **UISearchBar** functionality as well as the relevant protocal **UISearchBarDelegate** to
perform text-based search on the top of the app.
